Implementation using OrderedDict:

Time Complexity:

get(key): O(1) - Both dictionary lookups and moving an item to the end of the OrderedDict take constant time.
put(key, value): O(1) - Dictionary insertions, updates, and moving an item to the end of the OrderedDict all 
take constant time.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this implementation is O(capacity) because it requires storing the key-value pairs in 
the dictionary and maintaining the order of keys in the OrderedDict. The size of the dictionary and OrderedDict 
will be limited to the specified cache capacity.
